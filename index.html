        <div id="PageText">

            <p>
            	Welcome to my website for my project for CSPB 3112! I will start with a brief introduction to my project, and then get right into my weekly updates, which I will update each week with my progress on my learning and my project. So, let's get into it!</p>
			
			<h3>Vision Statement</h3>
	
            <p>
           		 I am looking to learn into replicating real world processes in coding using Processing, JavaScript, and p5.js.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Topic</h3>
            
            <p>
            	I have been getting into more creative applications of coding in my free time and that has where I have found a lot of my current passion for coding to come from. Between coding at work and school, I needed to find something to do for coding that was just for me and found that in Processing and creative in general. Processing is a program with a terrible name, but is a cool and powerful tool for creative coding in a variety of languages. It was originally written for Java, but has now been ported to Python and JavaScript. I started to learn it on Python but quickly moved onto JavaScript as it felt more intuitive. So that is the primary language and library I will be using for my topic. As for what I will be learning, I am going to be completing a study of the Nature of Code textbook by Daniel Shiffman. This textbook is available for free at https://natureofcode.com/book/. The book is about learning how to translate natural processes in life into code using Processing. It is technically written in Java, but the jump to JavaScript is menial. The book covers a wide range of topics, starting at programming Vectors and natural forces in physics, but ramps up to topics such as neural networks, cellular automata, and fractals. I was excited to get this book but have not had the time to dedicate I would like to. This class gives me the perfect opportunity to do just that!

            <h3>Deliverables and Specific/Measurable Goals</h3>

            <p>
            	For my learning journey in this class, I will be following the syllabus recommended in the book. It is a 14 week syllabus, but I will be condensing it just a tiny bit to fit 14 weeks. It will not be difficult to do this! Below is my overall goal for learning from this book:
            </p>
            
            <h4>Primary Goals Learning Goals:</h4>
            
            <ul>
   				<li>Introduction</li>
    			<li>Vectors (Chapter 1)</li>
    			<li>Forces (Chapter 2)</li>
    			<li>Oscillations (Chapter 3)</li>
    			<li>Particle Systems (Chapter 4)</li>
    			<li>Physics Libraries Part I (Chapter 5)</li>
    			<li>Physics Libraries Part II & Steering (Chapters 5-6)</li>
    			<li>Complex Systems: Flocking (Chapter 6)</li>
			</ul>
            
            <h4>Stretch Goals (If Time Allows):</h4>
            
            <ul>
    			<li>1D Cellular Automata (Chapters 6-7)</li>
    			<li>Complex Systems: 2D Cellular Automata and Fractals (Chapters 7-8)</li>
    			<li>Genetic Algorithms (Chapter 9)</li>
    			<li>Neural Networks (Chapter 10)</li>
			</ul>

            <p>
                  For my deliverables, I will be providing two things. First, each week I will write up a summary of what I learned from that weeks chapter(s). Additionally, the book has a proposed project that should be continuously worked on while taking the course. I will post below the prompt for the project provided in the book:
            </p>

                

            <h4>The Ecosystem Project</h4>
          

            <p>
                <i>As much as I’d like to pretend you could learn everything by curling up in a comfy chair and reading some prose about programming, to learn programming, you’re really going to have to do some programming. You might find it helpful to keep in mind a project idea (or two) to develop as a set of exercises while going from chapter to chapter. In fact, when teaching the Nature of Code course at ITP, I have often found that students enjoy building a single project, step by step, week by week, over the course of a semester.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the end of each chapter, you’ll find a series of exercises for one such project—exercises that build on each other, one topic at a time. Consider the following scenario. You’ve been asked by a science museum to develop the software for a new exhibit—The Digital Ecosystem, a world of animated, procedural creatures that live on a projection screen for visitors to enjoy as they enter the museum. I don’t mean to suggest that this is a particularly innovative or creative concept. Rather, we’ll use this example project idea as a literal representation of the content in the book, demonstrating how the elements fit together in a single software project. I encourage you to develop your own idea, one that is more abstract and creative in its thinking.</i>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                This Ecosystem Project is my goal for a final submission/project! I am going to work on it each week, and the book is structured around working on this project. It has the set goal of being able to add a little bit to the project each week at the end of each chapter. So I will be providing those updates each week as well, and at the end of the semester I should have a completed little digital ecosystem created!
            <p>
            
            <h3>Risks</h3>
            <p>
                  I am confident at how I will perform this semester. I do not see a lot of risks regarding the project, or at least as far as actually learning the content goes. I think my biggest risk/challenge will be making sure I manage my time well and get all of the learning objectives done in time.
            </p>
          
            
            <h3>Mitigation</h3>
            <p>
             	I am working on a study/work plan for this project and class to make sure I do not fall behind and get everything done in time. I am hoping that my enthusiasm for the topic and the project will make this much easier!
            </p>

               

            <h3>Project Assessments</h3>
            <p>
            I mentioned this above but no harm in repeating. My assessment for this project will be a culmination of adding in parts from each chapter I read until I have created a full, simple digital ecosystem! My goal is to incorporate what I have learned at least through chapter 6 of the Nature of Code textbook, and if I have time permitting I will continue to add to the project! 
            </p>

             
			<p>
                And there it is! That is my project proposal/summary! Going forward, I will  be focusing on weekly updates!
