            <p>
                I used this week's prompt as inspiration, but did not follow it exactly. Instead of taking my creature from last week and incorporating a partilce system into it, I created a "swarm"
                of creatures that use what I learned about particle systems this week. This swarm is after the food that the blue creature is after as well. If he is not fast enough, the swarm will eat 
                up the food, and he will have to start looking somewhere else. Of course, that food is also going to be attacked by the swarm!
