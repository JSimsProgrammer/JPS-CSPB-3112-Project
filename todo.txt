1. First I want to incorporate more of the oscilating bugs. Should be easy.
2. Could I incorporate more of the other bugs. Make the canvas bigger and have much more going on?
3. Possibly a different background. Black is a little boring.
4. Do the spinning square for the wanderer.
5. Think of something interesting for the food seeker.
6. Make everything grow and shrink when they interact. 
7. Maybe add some stationary  beings that eat the smaller particles.
